# 001 HelloJob Project Planning

## Phase 1: Planning and Design (Conceptual)
Objective: Define the project vision, scope, and main features.
Activities:
- Market analysis and requirements definition.
- Creation of wireframes and mockups for the front-end.
- Structuring roles (clients, professionals, administrators, support).
- Drafting the microservices architecture.
- Choosing technologies (React, Node.js, SQLite, Firebase Firestore).

## Phase 2: Development Environment Setup
Objective: Create the initial infrastructure for the project.
Activities:
- Git repository setup.
- Creation of initial directories (backend, frontend).
- Node.js environment configuration for front-end and back-end.
- Docker implementation (optional).

## Phase 3: Back-end Development (Business Logic and API)
Objective: Build the back-end responsible for managing authentication, database, and business logic.
Activities:
- Implement back-end structure with Express (Node.js).
- Create models and tables (SQLite).
- Develop routes for different users (clients, professionals, admin, support).
- Configure JWT authentication and validation middleware.
- Add centralized logs, rate limiting, and auditing.
- Create email and notification services.

## Phase 4: Front-end Development (User Applications)
Objective: Create interfaces for clients, professionals, admin, and support.
Activities:
- Split the front-end into modules (client-app, professional-app, admin-panel, support-panel).
- Develop main pages: Login, Dashboard, User Management.
- Create reusable components (buttons, modals, headers).
- Implement communication with the API (Axios or Fetch).
- Test integration with the back-end.

## Phase 5: Testing (QA)
Objective: Ensure all functionalities are operating correctly.
Activities:
- Unit tests for the back-end (Jest).
- Interface tests for the front-end (React Testing Library).
- Simulate user flows (client hiring service, professional responding).
- Security testing (XSS, SQL Injection, brute force).

## Phase 6: Deployment
Objective: Make the system accessible for use.
Activities:
- Deploy the back-end to a server (Heroku, Render, Vercel).
- Deploy the front-end (Vercel, Netlify).
- Configure DNS and secure CORS.
- Monitor production errors (Sentry).

## Phase 7: Maintenance and Updates
Objective: Fix bugs and implement improvements.
Activities:
- Collect user feedback.
- Analyze logs and error reports.
- Add new features as needed.

## Role Simulation
To maximize learning, dedicate a few weeks to each position.
